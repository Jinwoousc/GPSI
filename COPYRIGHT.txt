@file description

GPfSI_run.ipynb - the Jupyter notebook file to configure and execute GPfSI
GPfSI_run.py - the Python file to configure and execute GPfSI

GPfSI.py - the main code of GPfSI
GPfSI_data.py - the subcode of GPfSI to generate and compute data
GPfSI_expressiontree.py - the subcode of GPfSI to construct and modify models (expression trees)
GPfSI_optimization.py - the subcode of GPfSI to optimize coefficients in models



@input/output data
Input
 - The data are automatically simulated within the code package.
 - Excitation and system responses (e.g., external force and displacement in model 1; initial concentration profile over space and its temporal evolution in model 2)
 
Output
 - The data will be saved in the results folder.
 - initial_case_#_configuration.npy: configuration information for an identification case
 - case_#_generation_#.npy: candidate models and their information over generations
 - final_case_#_session_#.npy: candidate models and their information at each session end 
 - lossfunction_case_#.pdf: figure for loss function values and their composition over generations
 - result_outline_case_#.csv: top 10 models at the last generation with their loss function values



@execution
If you use Jupyter notebook (v.6.2.0) based on Python (v.3.7.4),
1. You can modify GPfSI_run.ipynb to select an example (ODE or PDE case) and change hyperparameters.
2. You can execute GPfSI by running cell by cell in Jupyter notebook.

If you do use only Python (v.3.7.4),
1. You can modify GPfSI_run.py to select an example (ODE or PDE case) and change hyperparameters.
2. You can "python GPfSI_run.py" in your terminal or prompt to execute GPfSI.
